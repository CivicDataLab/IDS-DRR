Intelligent Data Solution for Disaster Risk Reduction (IDS-DRR) is an open-source platform that helps state-level and district-level Disaster Management Authorities to make timely data-driven decisions, prioritise expenditure of public funds and conduct public procurement in a manner that strengthens long-term disaster risk reduction and protects the most vulnerable people from the adverse effects of extreme weather events and climate change.
In this platform, we bring together diverse high-value datasets from satellite, environmental, social, economic, demographic, infrastructure, loss & damages to data regarding government response to derive timely insights.

## Partners
This 4-year project led by CivicDataLab & Open Contracting Partnership is planned to improve disaster risk reduction processes & practices in the state of Assam. It is supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.

## System Architecture
This project involves developing a comprehensive data management and analytics system with the following steps:

Identify: Determine required data, sources, and variables.
Collect: Gather raw data via APIs, QGIS, or scraping; start the data pipeline by storing it.
Process: Clean, transform, and standardize data, saving relevant variables in a database.
Model: Perform data modeling and store the outputs.
Analyze: Build a data analytics layer with access APIs.
Front-End: Develop a front-end analytics page.
Publish: Create a data publishing platform (opub) for historical and real-time data with admin-only upload access.
List: Implement a frontend page for accessing published datasets.
