# Background

Intense climate-related disasters have been on the rise worldwide. Floods are the most frequent of natural disasters, causing widespread devastation, loss of life and livelihoods as well as property damage and critical infrastructure failures. Of the 1.47 billion people directly exposed to the risk of intense flooding, over a third of them are poor and 132 million live in extreme poverty. In India, natural disasters claimed more than 2,000 lives in 2022 alone, with over 2.2 million people affected. In the last decade, [87% of deaths caused by natural disasters in India were due to floods](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/natural-disasters?time=2010..latest&facet=none&Disaster+Type=All+disasters+%28by+type%29&Impact=Deaths&Timespan=Annual&Per+capita=false&country=~IND).

Now more than ever, we need to help the most vulnerable people cope with the effects of our rapidly changing climate. But building resilience is hard. Disaster risk reduction involves different actors making multiple complex decisions across different stages of crisis management. Often information is fragmented and siloed, scattered across different agencies, in various different systems, locations and formats. This makes it difficult for decision-makers to make joined-up, data informed decisions that accurately reflect or prioritize the most urgent needs.

This is why the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP) and [CivicDataLab (CDL)](https://civicdatalab.in/) worked together on a transformational approach to break down silos, power-up data-driven decision-making and implement innovative reforms that better serve those at greatest risk of floods. Our Intelligent Data Solution for Disaster Risk Reduction (IDS-DRR) joins up government spending data with complex datasets spanning flood hazard, exposure and vulnerability. It is an integrated digital platform for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data related to floods to improve coordination and decision-making so that government spending can be targeted toward those who need it the most.

This will help governments and communities better:

- **Prepare** for floods through more robust flood planning and management activities that can help minimize the worst effects of floods on vulnerable communities
- **Repair and restore** essential infrastructure and infrastructure services in the aftermath of floods

## The Platform

[Intelligent Data Solution for Disaster Risk Reduction (IDS-DRR)](https://drr.open-contracting.in/en/analytics?indicator=risk-score&time-period=2023_08&boundary=district) joins up complex datasets spanning flood hazard, exposure, vulnerability and government contracts. This easy-to-use and easy-to-understand data tool/platform, complete with an interactive map, filters and tailored reports (down to the smallest administrative unit) makes it easier for decision-makers to identify and prioritize the right interventions that can minimize the impact of floods on the most vulnerable communities.

Decision makers will be able to see, at-a-glance, which communities are most vulnerable, where the most urgent interventions are needed and what investments have been made in the past. It will help them identify potential gaps or mismatches between need and spending.

## Partners

This 4-year project led by CivicDataLab & Open Contracting Partnership is planned to improve disaster risk reduction processes & practices in the state of Assam. It is supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.
